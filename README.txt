The Guardian

To start The Guardian, open main.py and run the file. You can decide to play either arcade mode, or zen mode.
Control the spaceship using the WASD (W-up, A-left, S-down, D-right) movement layout. Shoot enemies by left-
clicking the mouse. Aim using the mouse and hover the reticle over the enemies. Upgrade the spaceship with
cash accumulated by destroying aliens ships.

Arcade Mode:
Progress through 9 waves of enemies by destroying alien spaceships. Try to set the best time of completing this mode!

Zen Mode:
Take on an infinite range of enemies over many levels. Try to pass as many levels as possible to set the high score!

Bugs:
Some bugs may include waves of enemies not spawning in, enemies flying off the map, and the hero ship going past its boundary.
These bugs are very uncommon and rarely happen. I think I fixed these issues, but there is still a risk these bugs may happen.
